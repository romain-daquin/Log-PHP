Welcome to the Log-PHP wiki!

I am Romain Daquin, french developer [[Romain Daquin, website](http://rdaquin.fr)].

I often found in the situation of needing to use a log in web development, PHP in particular.

I just set up my own class to use simple and basic logs.

My script creates and updates a text file, which contains the logs. Two possible formats:
* Date - Title - Description
* Date - Description
